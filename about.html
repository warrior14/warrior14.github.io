        <p class="aboutText">I have a decade's worth of experience as a personal trainer with the aim of helping clients achieve their fitness goals and have a healthier 
            lifestyle . I also have 2 years of experience with being a home healthcare provider. Both of these humbling and fulfilling experiences
             have contributed to enhancing my critical thinking and problem solving skills. 
             Additionally, it has also refined my ability to work in a team environment to reach a common objective.
              When my software developer friend introduced me to coding,
               I realized that the tech field would allow me to apply the skills I've honed to continue my passion for helping others 
               with software development. As a software developer I feel gratified knowing that I can help more people through technology!</p>
